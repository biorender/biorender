# Blender Python Tools

## Geometry

All geometry methods return the object created.

## Functions

Define as variables which values come from obj.data at the top of each scope
where they are required.

Always return a previously assigned variable, not a statement to execute.
Except if you are in a loop and its faster to break out once you find what
you need.
