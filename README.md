# BioRender

Thanks for [Smart Biology](https://www.smart-biology.com/) for providing several models and resources!
- ATP Synthase
- phosholipid bilayer texture

## Abstract

Cellular processes are difficult to understand as illustrations, and animations are limited in their capacity to provide students with the oppurtunity to investigate questions through direct interaction. BioRender is a WebGL based engine for creating properly scaled cell models accessible from any modern web browser. Large components such as the mitochondria are procedurally generated and then [populated](https://github.com/biorender/biorender/issues/26) using PDB models. BioRender aims to lower the barrier to entry to understanding biology by providing a platform for real-time interaction with cellular structures and biochemical processes.

## API

*In development*

## Alpha Software Goals

* see cell from outside
* see nucleus
* zoom into mitochondria
* use Blender file for ATP Synthase
* animate functioning of enzyme
    * rotor
    * top static
    * conformational changes
    * hydrogens entering/leaving
* within pinched phospholipid bilayer

Some resources/inspiration:
* [Powering the Cell: Mitochondria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrS2uROUjK4)
* [Molecular animation of ATP synthase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM9buhWJjlA)

### Interactivity Exercises

* take apart dimer -> fall apart
* potential concentration change
* TBD
