* animate functioning of enzyme
    * rotor
    * top static
    * conformational changes
    * electrons entering/leaving
* within phospholipid bilayer

Some resources/inspiration:
* [Powering the Cell: Mitochondria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrS2uROUjK4)
* [Molecular animation of ATP synthase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM9buhWJjlA)

### Interactivity Exercises

* take apart dimer -> fall apart
* potential concentration change
